# Welcome to My Blog

This is a sample blog post that demonstrates several features.

## Math Rendering

Here's an inline equation: $E = mc^2$

And here's a block equation:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

The quadratic formula is another classic example:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

## Images

Here's a sample image:

## More Math

Let's show some more complex equations. The Taylor series expansion:

$$
e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots
$$

And the Pythagorean theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
